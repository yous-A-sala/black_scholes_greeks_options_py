Implementation of BSM model in python. Also calculates six greeks which calculate different partial derivatives with respect to C or P which may or may not depend on if it is a call or put.

Requires scipy. Maybe I remove this dependency in a future iteration but easy as is for now. If one would, the error function could be used or something.
